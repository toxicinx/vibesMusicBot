## 📕 Requirements

* FFmpeg - `npm install ffmpeg-static`

* [Python](http://python.com) (For youtube-dl to support 700+ more sites)


## 📗 How to use?

**This repository doesn't include a whole discord bot!**



If you're looking for the commands, Navigate through `commands/` folder. Make sure that you also have checked  through index.js since it has some codes inside of it that you will need.

- The system for the arguments are also is included inside of the message event in Index.js

- Make sure the argument system has a similar idea to mine, or you will get some problems with da argument system :/
